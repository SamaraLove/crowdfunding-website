        This is a crowdfunding site focused around cars. This crowdfunding
        website is project based like kickstarter with the idea revolving around
        cars, car parts and upgrades. The target audience for users is small
        business owners and ideas people trying to reach their financial goals
        for escalating and proving their projects or companies wanting to know
        whether the community wants a push towards a particular design/upgrade
        (like a paid petition).
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        All projects that fit these categories and have the potential for
        success will be advertised on this website. Projects will go through an
        “approval” process to ensure there are legitimate claims to request the
        communities’ funding support.
